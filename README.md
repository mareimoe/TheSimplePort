A collection of guides to setup basic Docker services on a Debian Linux host. The purpose of these guides is to help you get started with learning Docker, or if you need to setup those services quickly and manage them with Portainer's GUI. 

## Usage
To use these guides you need:
- Debian Linux (or a derevative distro like Ubuntu) installed on a local host  or a VPS.
- Basic familiarity with Linux command line tools.

To start with any service setup, please head to the guide [Configure The Environment: Debian, Docker & Portainer](ConfigureTheEnvironment/ConfigureTheEnvironment.md) to first setup Docker & Portainer on your host system.
